    <section id="Carbohydrates">
    <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>

    <img src="./media/Corn.jpg"width="300"height="300"alt="Carbohydrates"loading="lazy"title="corn">
    <p>Carbohydrates are the main source of energy for the body. They are made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Examples of foods in this class are-</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Bread</li>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <li>Pasta</li>
    <li>Potatoes</li>
    <li>Corn</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Carbohydrates are essential for maintaining proper brain function. The brain relies heavily on glucose, a simple form of carbohydrate, as its primary energy source. Without adequate carbohydrate intake, cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and learning can be impaired.</p>
    <p>In addition to providing energy, carbohydrates also play a crucial role in digestive health. Dietary fiber, a type of carbohydrate found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, helps regulate the digestive system by promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation. Fiber also aids in maintaining a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for overall health.</p>

    <section id="Proteins">
    <h2>Proteins</h2>

    <img src="media/Nuts.webp" width=300 height="300" alt="Proteins" loading="lazy" title="nuts">
    <p>Proteins are essential for growth and repair of the body. They are made up of amino acids. Examples of foods in this class are-</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Meat</li>
    <li>Fish</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Beans</li>
    <li>Nuts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Proteins are crucial for building and repairing tissues in the body. They are the building blocks of muscles, skin, enzymes, and hormones. Without adequate protein intake, the body cannot properly repair damaged tissues or build new ones, which can lead to muscle wasting and other health issues.</p>
    <p>In addition to their role in tissue repair, proteins also play a vital role in the immune system. Antibodies, which help fight off infections and diseases, are made up of proteins. Consuming enough protein helps ensure that the immune system functions optimally, protecting the body from harmful pathogens.</p>

    <section id="Fats">
    <h2>Fats</h2>
    <img src="media/Butter.png" width=300 height="300" alt="Fats" loading="lazy" title="butter">
    <img src="media/Avocado.png" width=300 height="300" alt="Fats" loading="lazy" title="avocado">
    <p>Fats are a concentrated source of energy. They are made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Examples of foods in this class are-</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Margarine</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
    <li>Avocado</li>
    <li>Nuts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Fats are essential for overall health and well-being. They are a major source of energy for the body, providing more than twice the amount of calories per gram compared to carbohydrates and proteins. Fats also play a crucial role in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, which are important for various bodily functions.</p>
    <p>In addition to providing energy, fats are also important for brain health. The brain is composed of about 60% fat, and consuming adequate amounts of healthy fats is essential for maintaining optimal brain function. Omega-3 fatty acids, in particular, are important for brain health and have been linked to improved cognitive function and reduced risk of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

    <img src="media/Vitamin B-jpg.jpg" width=300 height="300" alt="Vitamins" loading="lazy" title="vitamin B">
    <p>Vitamins are essential for various bodily functions. They are classified into two groups namely water-soluble and fat-soluble. Examples of vitamins are-</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Vitamin A</li>
    <li>Vitamin B</li>
    <li>Vitamin C</li>
    <li>Vitamin D</li>
    <li>Vitamin E</li>
    <li>Vitamin K</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Vitamins are essential for maintaining optimal health and well-being. They play a crucial role in various bodily functions, such as metabolism, immune function, and cell repair. Without adequate vitamin intake, the body cannot function properly, leading to a range of health issues.</p>
    <p>Each vitamin has its own unique role in the body. For example, vitamin A is important for vision, vitamin C is essential for immune function, and vitamin D is crucial for bone health. Consuming a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods rich in vitamins is essential for maintaining overall health and preventing nutrient deficiencies.</p>
